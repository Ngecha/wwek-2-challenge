Intro
My shopping list is a program that enables a user to type in their shopping list

How it works;
the user types in what they want to purchase in a input box written New Iem. When they press enter, it is populated. Below to the populated item,there is a button with a delete name. This button gives the user an opportunity to delete the item if  they change their mind. 
There is another button named clear. it clears the list at the end of the shopping.
To mark the item purchased, the item will turn blue when clicked.  
 
 Results.
 The end result is a list of shopping items. Which can be marked blue when purchased and can also be deleted when the user changes their mind.
